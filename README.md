# Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning Course

This repository contains my work from an advanced course on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The projects here showcase the application of various algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems through data analysis, model development, and evaluation. The repo includes the following key projects:

- **Assignment 1:** Predicting daily bicycle rental demand using a bike-sharing dataset. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and testing multiple modeling techniques to build an accurate and reliable prediction model.

- **Assignment 2:** Distinguishing between dialogue lines from the TV shows *Seinfeld* and *Friends*. Using a dataset of dialogue text, character information, and show labels, this project develops a model to classify the dialogue by show and explores performance across different characters.

- **Final Project:** Building a recommendation system for music. This project focuses on developing models that suggest the top 10 songs to users based on their listening preferences, enhancing the music discovery experience.

Feel free to explore the projects and see how advanced ML/DL techniques were applied to these diverse tasks.
